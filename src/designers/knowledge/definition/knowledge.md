# Knowledge designer

[knowledge.des](knowledge.des) specifies ADP's **Knowledge designer** (`etalii/knowledge`) in DESL 0.1: its metamodel, its three FBL bindings, its ids, its constraints, its table surface with the value types and their conversions, and one operation per gesture. This file holds what DESL 0.1 cannot say: the file in each of its three formats, complete enough to write one by hand; the layout and behaviour taken from Notion and where they differ; the conversion table for a change of type; the steps that write two files; entries without an id; and the findings.

**These definition files are authoritative.** The standalone host's specification `knowledge-designer` (in etalii.adp.ide.standalone, `.spec-workflow/specs/knowledge-designer/`) asked for them, and etalii.adp's [spec 013](../../specs/013-knowledge-designer/) delivered them; where either and these files disagree, these files win and the other is amended (standalone Requirement 1.7). Every other host builds the same designer from these files.

## The two files

A knowledge document is exactly two files: the **knowledge file**, which holds everything, and its **registration** beside it, which only identifies it. The knowledge file is a DED 0.1 definition ([DED](../../specifications/ded/DED-specification.md)): it begins with DED's envelope, which names DED's version and the designer type `etalii/knowledge`.

- The registration is an `.adp` file whose first line is `etalii/knowledge`, followed by `body: <file name>` when the names differ (FBL section 8). It holds nothing else: no property, row, view, width or position. Deleting it and creating it again changes nothing; the bindings set `createOnFirstPlacement: false` and store no layout.
- The knowledge file is YAML (`.yaml`, `.yml`), JSON (`.json`, or DED's own `.ded`) or XML (`.xml`). Each extension is claimed `shared`, with DED's envelope as its marker (DED section 4): a file is a knowledge file only when its envelope names `etalii/knowledge`, so ordinary YAML, JSON and XML files are never taken for one, and a knowledge file is recognised without its registration.
- The format is chosen when the document is added, from the three bindings' templates, and is never changed afterwards (DESL section 5): a change of format would rewrite every byte.
- A new document is one title property named `Name`, one view named `Table` and no rows; its ids are new ShortGuids.

## The table

The model is the same in every format; only the writing differs. Names in brackets are the metamodel's where they differ from the file's key, because DESL reserves `type` and `parent` (DESL section 2.2) and `targetFile` never reads as the `target` of an action (research R4).

| Entry | Holds | Id |
|---|---|---|
| The root | DED's envelope, `ded` (`0.1`) and `designer` (`etalii/knowledge`), then `name`, `activeView` (a view's id) | none: it is the table |
| `properties` | One entry per property, in column order: `id`, `name`, `type` (valueType), `title`, `target` (targetFile), `limit`, `counterpart`, `computed`, `parent` (isParent), and `options` for a selection | stored |
| `properties/*/options` | One entry per option, in order: `id`, `name`, `colour` | stored |
| `views` | One entry per view, in tab order: `id`, `name`, `filterMatch`, `columns`, `sorts`, `filter`, `groupBy`, `hideEmptyGroups`, `groupOrder`, `hiddenGroups`, `collapsed` | stored |
| `rows` | One entry per row: `id`, `cells` | stored |
| `rows/*/cells` | One entry per value: `property` and the value under its type's key | derived: `<row>/<property>` |
| `rows/*/cells/*/options`, `rows/*/cells/*/rows` | One entry per value of several: `option` or `row` | derived: `<cell>/<value>` |

Only `id`, `name` and `type` of a property, `id` and `name` of an option and of a view, and `id` of a row are required. Every other key is written only when it differs from its default: `title`, `computed`, `parent`, `wrap` and `hideEmptyGroups` are `false`, `visible` is `true`, `limit` is `none`, `colour` is `default`, `direction` is `ascending`, `filterMatch` is `all`.

- **A cell is an entry of its own** naming its property by id, so one unreadable value costs one cell and never its row, and nothing in the file is keyed by a name the file defines (standalone design, L1).
- **A value sits under a key named for its type** (section 4), so the file says what each value is without looking up its property, and a value that no longer fits its property's type stays readable.
- **Several values are several entries** (`options:` and `rows:` lists of `option:` or `row:` items), each added, removed and moved by its own splice in all three formats (L2).
- **Everything that names a property, an option, a view or a row names it by id.** Renaming changes one place. A removed property or option takes the cells, items and view settings naming it with it (`by: "id"`, FBL section 5.7).
- **Keys and elements the designer does not know are kept**, byte for byte, through every edit, and reported (`knowledge.unknown-key`, info). Comments are kept too.
- [knowledge.schema.json](knowledge.schema.json) is the JSON Schema of the YAML and JSON forms. It refuses unknown keys, which the designer keeps but reports; what it cannot check (that a cell names a property of the table, one title) are the constraints of `knowledge.des`.

## The file in each format

All three are written with CRLF line endings and two-space indentation when ADP creates them; a file written otherwise keeps its own style, and new entries follow the style of their siblings (FBL section 6.3).

**YAML.** A mapping with the envelope first and the root keys above, then `properties:`, `views:` and `rows:` as block sequences of mappings. A string that would read as something else (a date, a time, a number, `true`) is double-quoted; dates and times are always strings. Keys of a new entry are written in the order of the table above.

**JSON.** One object with the same keys. ADP writes each property, view and row as one line, with its options, settings and cells inside it on that line, so a row is one line of the file and a diff shows one line per changed row. A list written on one line is created with its first item and removed with its last (FBL section 6.2, 0.3). Comments are not allowed in JSON, so a JSON knowledge file has none.

**XML.** The root element is DED's, `<ded version="0.1" designer="etalii/knowledge" name="…" activeView="…">`, and holds `<properties>`, `<views>` and `<rows>`. Every key becomes an attribute; every list becomes repeated child elements, named in the singular:

| YAML and JSON | XML |
|---|---|
| `properties: [ {…} ]` | `<properties><property …/></properties>` |
| a property's `options: [ {…} ]` | `<option …/>` children of `<property>` |
| a view's `columns`, `sorts` | `<column …/>`, `<sort …/>` children of `<view>` |
| a view's `filter`: conditions and groups | `<condition …/>` and `<filterGroup match="…">` children of `<view>`; a group's conditions are its children |
| a view's `groupOrder`, `hiddenGroups`, `collapsed` | `<groupOrder key="…"/>`, `<hiddenGroup key="…"/>`, `<collapsed key="…"/>` children of `<view>` |
| `rows: [ { id, cells } ]` | `<rows><row id="…"><cell …/></row></rows>` |
| a cell's `options: [ {option} ]`, `rows: [ {row} ]` | `<item option="…"/>`, `<item row="…"/>` children of `<cell>` |

In XML the order among a view's children of different kinds carries no meaning; the order among children of one kind does. An element that loses its last child closes itself again (`<view …/>`), and its first child opens it. Booleans are `true` and `false`, numbers are written as JSON writes them, and the five predefined entities escape what must be escaped.

The three are equivalent: the same table written in each reads as the same elements with the same attributes and the same findings. The fixture `specifications/fbl/fixtures/knowledge-equivalence` reads the examples below in all three, and `knowledge-yaml`, `knowledge-json` and `knowledge-xml` take one table through every kind of edit with the exact bytes each writes.

## Values

| Type (`type`) | Cell key | Written as | Editor | Comparisons | Sort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Text (`text`) | `text` | a string | free text | is, is-not, contains, does-not-contain, starts-with, ends-with | by text, ignoring case |
| Number (`number`) | `number` | a number, in its shortest form | a number | equals, does-not-equal, greater-than, less-than, at-least, at-most | numeric |
| Checkbox (`checkbox`) | `checked` | `true` or `false` | a checkbox | is-checked, is-not-checked | unchecked first |
| Date (`date`) | `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | a date, typed or picked | is, is-before, is-after, is-on-or-before, is-on-or-after | chronological |
| Date and time (`dateTime`) | `dateTime` | ISO 8601 with its offset, as entered (`2026-10-08T09:30:00+02:00`, `…Z`) | a date and a time | as date | chronological |
| Time (`time`) | `time` | `HH:MM` or `HH:MM:SS` | a time | as date | chronological |
| Selection (`selection`) | `option` | an option's id | one option, picked or typed to create | is, is-not | the options' order |
| Multiple selection (`multipleSelection`) | `options` | a list of `option:` items | several options, picked or typed to create | contains, does-not-contain | the options' order, by the first value |
| Relation (`relation`) | `rows` | a list of `row:` items, each a row id of the target file | rows of the target file, searched by title | contains, does-not-contain | by the first related row's title |

Every type also offers `is-empty` and `is-not-empty`. A filter condition stores its comparison as `operator` and the value it compares with under the same key a cell would use. Empty values sort last in both directions.

**Colours** are Notion's ten names: `default`, `gray`, `brown`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`, `red`. Each host draws each as one token for the light theme and one for the dark theme, with its own colours.

**The title property** is the one text property with `title: true`. Its value names a row wherever the row is shown outside its own table, as in another table's relation cell. It cannot be deleted, hidden or given another type.

## Views

A file has at least one view. A view stores only what differs from the default:

- **Columns.** A property without a `columns` entry is visible, at the default width, without wrapping. The listed columns come first, in their order; the others follow in property order. `width` is in pixels at 100% zoom, at least 32.
- **Sorts.** In order: the first sorts first. A view with sorts does not let rows be dragged.
- **Filter.** A list of conditions and groups combined by `filterMatch`. A group (`match: all` or `any`, and `conditions`) nests to three levels counting the view's own list.
- **Grouping.** `groupBy` names a selection, multiple selection, checkbox or relation property, or the parent relation. Each value is a group, plus one for rows without a value; a row with several values appears under each. A group's **key** is the option's id, the related row's id, `true` or `false`, or `none` for rows without a value. `groupOrder` lists keys in the order shown (unlisted groups follow in their natural order), `hiddenGroups` the groups not shown, `collapsed` the groups shown collapsed, and `hideEmptyGroups` hides groups without rows. Grouped by the parent relation, rows are nested under their parents to any depth, and `collapsed` lists the parent rows whose children are hidden.
- `activeView` on the root names the view the file was last left in; absent, the first view. Switching views is an edit, saved and undoable like any other (standalone Requirement 6.10).
- Scroll position, the selection and the cell being edited are never stored.

Group settings belong to the grouping: grouping by another property, or ungrouping, removes them. Deleting an option removes the group settings keyed by it.

## Layout and behaviour

The Knowledge designer looks and works as Notion's table view does (standalone Requirement 7), drawn with the host's own theme, fonts and controls in both themes. It copies none of Notion's icons, fonts or artwork.

- **Views as tabs** above the table, with a `+` to add one. A tab's menu renames, duplicates and deletes; tabs are reordered by dragging.
- **The bar** beside the tabs: filter, sort, group and property visibility. Under it, each sort and each filter is a removable item; clicking one opens it for editing.
- **The header row**: one header per visible column with its type's icon (`knowledge.des`, enum `ValueType`) and name. Dragging a header moves the property; dragging its right border sets the view's width. A `+` after the last column adds a property.
- **A column's menu**: rename, change type, filter by it, sort ascending, sort descending, group by it, hide in this view, wrap, insert left, insert right, duplicate and delete. A selection's menu also lists its options, to rename, recolour, reorder by dragging and delete.
- **Rows** beneath, and a *new* row at the bottom of the table and of every group. A row added in a group gets the value that puts it there. A new row stays visible in the view until the view is next opened, even when the filter would hide it.
- **Cells** are edited in place, over the cell, by their type's editor. Options and relations open a searchable list that also creates: typing a name that is not an option and confirming creates the option. Selection values are rounded tags in their option's colour.
- **Relations** are created as in Notion: choose the target file (in a dialog that offers only knowledge files, *this file* first), one row or no limit, optionally show it on the target too and name that side, then confirm.
- **Keyboard**: the arrow keys move between cells, Enter starts and commits an edit, Escape cancels it, Tab moves to the next cell, and a key adds a row. Selected rows are deleted with Delete. The table exposes the roles of a grid.
- **Selection**: one or more rows; a single selected row's properties appear in the host's property grid.

**Where it differs from Notion** (standalone Requirement 7.7), and only here: properties, views and files are local and plain text; there are no pages inside rows, no people, no comments and no sharing; the property types are the nine above; only the table view exists (no board, calendar, gallery, list, timeline or chart), with no sub-groups, no calculations under a column and no frozen columns.

## Findings

Reading never fails on content: what cannot be accepted is a finding at its place, and everything readable is shown. Nothing unreadable is removed on the next write.

| Code | Severity | Where | Stated by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `knowledge.no-title` | warning | the table | constraint `noTitle` |
| `knowledge.several-titles` | warning | the second and later title properties | constraint `severalTitles` |
| `knowledge.title-not-text` | error | the title property | constraint `titleIsText` |
| `knowledge.duplicate-property-name` | error | the second and later properties of one name, ignoring case | constraint `uniquePropertyNames` |
| `knowledge.unknown-property` | warning | a cell naming no property | constraint `unknownProperty` |
| `knowledge.value-of-another-type` | warning | a cell whose value is under another type's key | constraint `valueOfAnotherType` |
| `knowledge.unknown-option` | warning | a value naming no option of its property | constraints `unknownOption`, `unknownItemOption` |
| `knowledge.relation-over-limit` | warning | a cell holding several rows of a relation limited to one | constraint `relationOverLimit` |
| `knowledge.view-names-missing-property` | warning | a column, sort, condition or grouping naming no property; the view opens without it | constraints `viewNamesMissingProperty`, `groupByMissingProperty` |
| `knowledge.filter-too-deep` | warning | a filter group nested deeper than three levels | constraint `filterDepth` |
| `knowledge.no-view` | warning | the table; it opens as if it had one view with no settings | constraint `lastView` |
| `knowledge.unknown-type` | warning | a property whose `type` is none of the nine; its cells are shown as text and cannot be edited | the host |
| `knowledge.unresolved-target` | warning | a relation property whose target file is missing, unreadable or not a knowledge file | the host |
| `knowledge.unresolved-row` | warning | a relation value naming a row that is not in the target file | the host |
| `knowledge.parent-cycle` | error | a row that would be its own ancestor through the parent relation | the host: DESL's expressions do not recurse over values |
| `knowledge.missing-id` | info | a property, option, view or row without an id (section 10) | the host |
| `knowledge.unknown-key` | info | a key or element the designer does not know; kept | the host |
| `knowledge.newer-version` | warning | a file whose DED version (`ded`) is newer than 0.1; it opens read-only (DED section 4) | the host |

FBL's and DESL's own findings apply too (DESL section 6.5): an entry that cannot be read is `std.unreadableEntry` and keeps its bytes; a file that is not well-formed is `std.unparseable`, opens empty and read-only, and is never written; a file without DED's envelope is unreadable; two entries with one id are `std.duplicateId`.

## Changing a property's type

A change of type converts, in the same step, every value that has a meaning in the new type; a value that has none keeps its old key and bytes and is reported as `knowledge.value-of-another-type` on its cell. No value is discarded (DESL section 7.6, standalone Requirement 3.4).

| From ↓ to → | Text | Number | Checkbox | Date, date and time, time | Selection | Multiple selection | Relation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Text | | parsed | `true`, `false` | parsed as ISO 8601 | the option of that name, ignoring case, created when there is none | as selection, one item | kept |
| Number | its written form | | kept | kept | kept | kept | kept |
| Checkbox | `true`, `false` | kept | | kept | kept | kept | kept |
| Date, date and time, time | its written form | kept | kept | kept (each to another) | kept | kept | kept |
| Selection | the option's name | kept | kept | kept | | the option as the only item | kept |
| Multiple selection | the names, joined by `, ` | kept | kept | kept | the only item, when there is one | | kept |
| Relation | the related rows' titles, joined by `, ` | kept | kept | kept | kept | kept | |

*Kept* means not converted. Converting writes the new key where the binding's key order puts it and removes the old one (fixture step "A number converted to text"). Options created by a conversion are created in the same step. Changing a type away from relation keeps the property's `target`, `limit` and `counterpart` until the type changes back or the property is deleted; the title property's type does not change.

## Relations and the steps that write two files

A relation property names its target file by a path relative to its own file (`target`, `.` for the file itself) and holds, per cell, row ids of that file. To FBL a row id in another file is a plain string: the designer resolves it, reads the target file read-only for titles and watches it.

A **two-way** relation is stored on one side (standalone Q5): the property that was created holds the values, and the target file gets a **counterpart** property with `computed: true`, no cells, and `counterpart` naming the first property's id; the first names the counterpart's id in its own `counterpart`. The counterpart shows, per row, the rows of the first file that point at it.

These steps change two files, and every host **MUST** make each one undoable step (DESL section 5): plan the edit of both bodies first, write neither when either edit is refused, write both, and record one history entry whose undo restores both files' bytes.

| Step | This file | The other file |
|---|---|---|
| Create a two-way relation | add the property, with `counterpart` | add the computed counterpart |
| Delete one side of a two-way relation | delete the property | the user chooses: delete the counterpart too, or keep it as a one-way relation (remove `computed` and `counterpart`; it then holds values of its own) |
| Rename or move a target file inside ADP | rewrite `target` in every open file that names it | move or rename the file |

Deleting a row that rows of other files relate to first says how many; their values naming it are then unresolved (`knowledge.unresolved-row`) and are not removed. A value whose target is missing is never removed by ADP (standalone Requirement 5.7).

**The parent relation** is a relation to the file itself with `parent: true` and `limit: one`. A row's parent is the row its cell names; grouping a view by it nests rows under their parents, and a change that would make a row its own ancestor is refused (`knowledge.parent-cycle` when a file already holds one).

## Entries without an id

A property, option, view or row written without an id (by hand or by a language model) is read with an id the host makes up, is shown, and is reported as `knowledge.missing-id` (info). The first edit made in ADP to the file writes a new ShortGuid into every such entry, in the same step (DESL `ids.missing: "assign"`, DESL section 5.3.4), so references to it can be stored. Cells, items and view settings have no id of their own and never need one.

## Gestures and operations

`knowledge.des` declares one operation per gesture, so every host makes the same model changes for the same gesture. The gesture that starts each is the host's; this host-independent mapping is what the standalone host offers:

| Gesture | Operation |
|---|---|
| `+` after the last column; insert left or right | `addProperty` (`after` the column to the left) |
| Column menu: rename, change type, duplicate, delete | `renameProperty`, `changePropertyType`, `duplicateProperty`, `deleteProperty` |
| Dragging a header | `moveProperty` |
| Use as title, use as parent | `setTitleProperty`, `setParentRelation` |
| New relation | `createRelation` (with the two-file step above) |
| Typing a new option in a cell, option menu | `addOption`, `renameOption`, `recolourOption`, `moveOption`, `deleteOption` |
| *New* row, Delete on selected rows, dragging a row | `addRow`, `deleteRows`, `moveRow` |
| Editing a cell | `setText`, `setNumber`, `setChecked`, `setDate`, `setDateTime`, `setTime`, `setOption`, `addItem`, `removeItem`, `clearCell` |
| View tab: `+`, rename, duplicate, delete, drag, click | `addView`, `renameView`, `duplicateView`, `deleteView`, `moveView`, `switchView` |
| Hide, show, resize, wrap, reorder a column in a view | `setColumn`, `moveColumn`, `resetColumn` |
| Sort bar | `addSort`, `setSortDirection`, `moveSort`, `removeSort` |
| Filter bar | `addCondition`, `setCondition`, `removeCondition`, `addFilterGroup`, `setMatch` |
| Group menu, group headings | `groupBy`, `ungroup`, `hideEmptyGroups`, `setGroup`, `unsetGroup`, `moveGroup` |

## What DESL 0.1 cannot express

- The file's three forms and how XML writes lists (section 3): the bindings say it, DESL only names them.
- The layout and behaviour taken from Notion (section 6): DESL's `surface` names which types play which part, not how a host draws them.
- Conversions beyond their kind: what a written form is, that a multiple selection's names are joined by `, ` (section 8).
- The steps that write two files and their atomicity (section 9): DESL requires it of a host, FBL keeps one history per body.
- Relation values across files: a row of another file is a plain id here, resolved by the host, so its findings are the host's.
- A parent cycle, which needs a recursive walk over values.
- The view logic itself (how a filter, a sort and a grouping select and order rows): stated by the value types' comparisons and sorts and by section 5, and implemented by each host.

## Complete examples

The examples in [examples/](examples/) are one table, the Cities of the Low Countries, written in each format. Each validates against [knowledge.schema.json](knowledge.schema.json) (XML through the mapping of section 3) and reads through its binding without findings; the validator checks both on every pull request.
