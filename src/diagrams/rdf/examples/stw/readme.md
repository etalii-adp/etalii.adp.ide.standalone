# STW Thesaurus for Economics

**What it demonstrates.** A real published thesaurus, in the tradition this reading was designed
for — a bilingual, notated, deeply polyhierarchical vocabulary maintained by a national library
rather than a toy taxonomy invented to flatter the diagram.

- `geographic-names.ttl` is subthesaurus **G**, 435 concepts, whole and under the 1,000-element
  drawn-element budget — so it opens complete, and the hierarchy, the notation badges and the
  `skos:related` cross-links are all visible at once. 272 of its concepts have more than one
  `skos:broader`, which is the polyhierarchy Requirement 1.6 draws once rather than repeating.
- `business-economics.ttl` is subthesaurus **B**, breadth-first from its root to 1,150 concepts —
  deliberately past the budget, so the truncated first-N view and its showing-N-of-M banner have
  a real vocabulary to be honest about (Requirement 8). Breadth-first because that is the order
  the budget itself cuts in: the extract is the top of a real hierarchy, not an arbitrary slice.

Both registrations carry a `language:` header — `en` on one, `de` on the other — so the same
vocabulary can be opened in either language and the label chooser's preference order is visible
from the explorer rather than only in tests.

**Provenance.**

  triple rather than from the download page. That check mattered: the page carries a
  `rel="license"` link to ODbL and a `by-nc-sa` badge as well, either of which would have
  disqualified the source under the share-alike rule, and the data's own statement is what
  settles it. Full text in `LICENSE.txt`.

- Exact local changes: both files are **extracts**, not copies. From the full distribution:
  one subthesaurus was selected by following `skos:narrower` from its top concept; the scheme
  block was kept with its `skos:hasTopConcept` narrowed to that one root; and every
  `skos:narrower`/`broader`/`related`/`*Match` object list was filtered to concepts the extract
  actually carries, so no assertion points at a concept that is not here. No triple was
  otherwise altered, no label or notation was touched, and nothing was added. The extractor is
  described here rather than shipped, because it is a one-off against one distribution's layout.

**What this pair does not demonstrate**, said plainly so the next person does not go looking:
STW states no `skos:Collection` at all, and its `skos:prefLabel`s are completely bilingual —
every concept has both German and English. So neither the collection groups of Requirement 1.5
nor the incomplete-translation case behind the language chip of Requirement 3.3 has real data
here. Both are covered by fixtures in `EtAlii.Adp.Diagram.Rdf.Tests`; neither is covered by a
vendored vocabulary. Sources that would have carried them were considered and rejected at
acquisition: the UNESCO Thesaurus is CC BY-SA (share-alike), AGROVOC labels through SKOS-XL
which this reading deliberately does not resolve, and EuroVoc's distribution sits behind a
portal handler rather than a fetchable file.
