"""Places the influence anchors of a .ghg example: python spread-anchors.py <file.ghg>...

Every drawn influence keeps its phases and edges; only its from-at and to-at change, and every other
byte of the file is kept. The rule, which GhgExampleInfluencePhaseTests holds every example to:

- An influence arrives no earlier than it leaves: the date under its To end is at or after the date
  under its From end. Both start at one moment the two phases share; where they share none, the
  cause's end sits late in its phase and the effect's early in its own, and the two are not drawn together.
- The ends sharing one edge of one phase spread evenly across it, in date order, keeping clear of
  the phase's ends. An end alone on its edge leans only gently to the middle, so its dates decide.
  Where the first rule leaves an edge's ends bunched, its first end goes as early and its last as
  late as each one's partner allows, the rest evenly between.
- Rounding to two decimals goes towards each other, the cause down and the effect up, so it never
  breaks the first rule.

An influence from a trigger has no From end: the trigger's date is where it leaves, and only its To
end is placed - no earlier than that date, and spread with the other ends on its edge.

Run it again after adding trends, triggers or influences to an example; an influence on a hidden phase
is not drawn and is left as written.
