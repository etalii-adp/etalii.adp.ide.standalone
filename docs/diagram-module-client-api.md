# The diagram module client API

**Everything a diagram module's client may reach for, and nothing it may not.** One document, so a module author does not have to read the canvas library to find out what is offered — and so a name leaving module use is a change to a page rather than a discovery made by a broken build.

## How to read this document

**Each entry answers the same six questions, in the same order:** what the thing is for; whether a module needs it and what happens without it; its shape; a worked example taken from a real module; the guards that constrain it; and what to read next.

**An entry begins with its declarations.** The line `**Declarations:**` names, in backticks, every declaration the entry covers. Those lines together are what this document claims to cover, and the test reads them:

```
### Element types
**Declarations:** `ElementTypeDefinition`, `BuiltInShape`, `CustomShapeRef`
```

**An excerpt names its source.** A fenced code block is preceded by a `Source:` line linking the file it was taken from, and the block appears in that file verbatim, line endings aside:

```
Source: [`src/diagrams/dependency-graph/client/DependencyGraphCanvas.tsx`](../src/diagrams/dependency-graph/client/DependencyGraphCanvas.tsx)
```

**`dependency-graph` is the reference module.** Examples come from it wherever it exercises the aspect, so a reader following one module's code can find every excerpt in one place rather than assembling a picture from eight.

### What is authoritative here, and what is linked

**This document is authoritative for the module-facing surface**: which declarations a module may use, what each is for, and which are library-internal. When it disagrees with a module that reaches past the surface, this document is right and the module is the thing to change.

**It is not authoritative for mechanism.** How the canvas draws, how scrolling works, how a label is measured and how the stream is consumed are described where that code lives, and this document links them rather than restating them:

- [`src/client/src/diagrams/readme.md`](../src/client/src/diagrams/readme.md) — the stream, the view report and the module-side hooks
- [`src/client/src/canvas/elements/readme.md`](../src/client/src/canvas/elements/readme.md) — element geometry and shapes
- [`src/client/src/canvas/label/readme.md`](../src/client/src/canvas/label/readme.md) — label measurement and placement
- [`src/client/src/canvas/gesture/readme.md`](../src/client/src/canvas/gesture/readme.md) — the shared gesture layer
- [`src/client/src/canvas/scroll/readme.md`](../src/client/src/canvas/scroll/readme.md) — scrolling and the viewport

**And it is not a tutorial.** [`creating-a-diagram-module.md`](creating-a-diagram-module.md) walks a whole module from nothing to a drawn diagram; this document is what that walkthrough reaches into, entry by entry.

### How this document stays true

**It is checked against the code on every client test run, not reviewed.** The command is:

```bash
npm test -- src/diagramModuleClientApi.test.ts
```

from `src/client`. The test computes the module-facing surface by parsing the tree — what modules import, and what they supply by value — and fails when this document covers a name that no longer exists, omits one a module uses, or quotes an excerpt that has changed in its source.

**Every figure quoted below says what it counts and when it was read**, because a count with neither is a number a reader cannot check. Figures in this document were read at `d1cc0da3` unless their own sentence says otherwise, and the test recomputes them rather than trusting them.
